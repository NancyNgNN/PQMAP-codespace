# PQMAP - Workshop #2 Summary
**Date:** January 15, 2026  
**Duration:** ~45 minutes (excerpt)  
**Attendees:** CLP Team (Chrissy, Bob, Woody, Crystal), JKTech Team (Simon), Development Team (Fung)

---

## Key Decisions

### Documentation & Tracking
- **Excel as Central Tracker**: All requirement updates will continue in Excel file with enhanced columns for menu location and file references
- **External SharePoint Migration**: Excel file moved to external SharePoint due to access limitations for Simon's team
- **Three Artifact Strategy**: Maintain Excel tracker, functional design documentation, and interactive prototypes as primary artifacts

### Data Management
- **Data Mapping Progress**: 70-80% of required data mapping completed between legacy and new PQMAP system
- **Reference Documentation**: Legacy system CSV files and data specifications to be consolidated for team reference
- **Data Schema Documentation**: Separate PowerPoint maintains detailed data structure, source mappings, and field relationships

### Meeting Structure
- **Workshop Focus**: Sessions will concentrate on functional requirements, operational workflows, and backend logic discussions
- **Collaborative Review**: Operations team (Woody, Crystal) to explain system usage; Technical team (Simon) to cover backend logic

## Pain Points Identified

| Pain Point | Current Impact | Solution |
|------------|----------------|----------|
| **SharePoint Storage Full** | Cannot upload new documents (1GB limit reached) | Storage increase requested; Compress/remove meeting recordings temporarily |
| **External Team Access** | Simon's team unable to edit main SharePoint | Migrate Excel tracker to external SharePoint for joint editing |
| **Excel Complexity** | Difficult to reference location and related files | Add columns for menu path and file link references |

---

## Priority Action Items

### Immediate (Next 1-2 weeks)
- **Chrissy**: Request IT approval for additional SharePoint storage capacity
- **Bob**: Compress meeting recordings to free up space or archive externally
- **Fung/Simon**: Add two new Excel columns - menu location reference and related file links
- **Woody/Crystal**: Consolidate legacy system CSV files and specifications for team reference

### Design Phase
- Complete remaining 20-30% of data mapping documentation
- Link Excel requirements to functional design documents
- Update functional design with workshop outcomes

### Documentation
- Post meeting: Share external SharePoint link to all team members
- Maintain comment tracking in functional design documents (photo type/Europe files)
- Keep prototype links updated with latest design iterations

## Special Topics: Document Management Structure

### Excel Tracker Structure
- **Blue sections**: Functional requirements organized by module (Event Management, Asset Management, Reporting, etc.)
- **Module-based**: Maps to system navigation structure (e.g., Event Management → Network Management → Event Details)
- **RFP Mapping**: Column C references original RFP section numbers
- **Index System**: Unique index numbers for cross-document referencing
- **Categories**: Includes functional requirements, industry standards, and deferred features

### Artifact Hierarchy
1. **Excel Tracker**: Requirement details with status, criticality, RFP mapping
2. **Functional Design (Figma/Europe)**: Visual mockups with requirement index cross-references and inline comments
3. **Prototypes**: Interactive demos with shareable links (editable by team)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Simon/Fung**: Implement Excel column enhancements for menu path and file references (pending storage resolution)
2. **Chrissy**: Follow up on storage upgrade request; Provide temporary workaround for document access
3. **Bob**: Compress and archive meeting recordings to free immediate storage space
4. **Team**: Use external SharePoint for Excel updates until main site storage resolved
5. **Workshop Series**: Continue functional requirement walkthroughs with focus on operations and backend logic

## Notes
- Meeting conducted in Cantonese with screen sharing of Excel and PowerPoint documentation
- Storage issue is blocking immediate collaborative updates - temporary workaround in place
- Excel update workflow now involves external team members requiring dedicated SharePoint access
- Link to external SharePoint will be shared post-meeting in Teams/Slack
