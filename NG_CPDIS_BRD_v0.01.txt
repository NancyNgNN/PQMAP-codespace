problem statement

In recent years, there have been instances of ACB tripping, leading to
supply outages for customers and attracting significant public
attention. Additionally, with the increasing penetration of electronic
loads and renewable power sources in our daily lives, the impact of
harmonic emissions has become a growing concern for power utilities.

Beside post-incident investigation of Power Quality (PQ) instances, CLP
provides proactive services such as

-   Voltage Dip Simulation Test

-   Power Quality Measurement

-   Planning-Ahead

These services rely on Customer Power Disturbance Information System
(CPDIS), which has been established since 2019 at strategic customer
substations and Power Quality Management System (PQMS) at CLP
substations. These systems capture various parameters for further
analysis and evaluates existing mitigation measures to ensure optimal
service for our customers.

The current power quality incident investigation process could be a
lengthy and complex process due to time needed in sourcing and
transforming information from multiple platforms. Firstly, information
is stored in two PQ platforms, and they do not have the same level of
analytic capabilities. Secondly, engineers need to manually derive
impact customers and sensitive customers from other systems, such as
Supply Point System for customer and substation mapping and EWMS for
incident, substation, and transformer mapping.

In addition, not all engineers can access all PQ systems due to security
deviation in previous network architecture design. The new OT Cyber
Security Standard 2.0 introduced in September 2023 is a trigger for the
business to rethink of a better way for access information.


goal statement and bebefits

The business proposes a consolidated PQ platform to provide engineers
and account managers a single platform to improve CLP’s power quality
services.

A system where CLP engineers and account managers can

-   Provide Voltage Dip Simulation Test, Power Quality Measurement &
    Planning-Ahead services more efficiently and productively.

-   Conduct post-incident investigation of with better speed and
    accuracy, be it on CLP side or Customer side.

-   Filter out the noisy events and focus on high impact power quality
    events.

The new consolidated PQ platform will allow CLP to be a more customer
focus and supporting its vision of becoming the Utility of Future.

Customers will benefit from receiving world-class and proactive
measurement and monitoring services to mitigate PQ instances. In
unavoidable PQ instances, customers will experience reduction in outage
duration or equipment damage, result in minimization of financial and
reputation loss.

CLP will benefit from providing more value-adding PQ services,
improvement in its corporate standing and uplifting employee
satisfaction as it creates an environment where employees are Empowered
with new skills and ways of working.


roadmap

To meet the business vision of a consolidated platform, and in view of
business constraints such as financial, budgetary and procurement
processes, team capacity and workload estimation, power quality team
proposed a three stages approach, spreading the work over two years.

CURRENT STATE


what is CPDIS

Customer Power Disturbance Information System (CPDIS) is a real time
system collecting power disturbance data on customer side in CLP’s
distribution network. CLP engineers use the data collected to

-   Strengthen supply reliability by formulating cost-effective solution
    to alleviate the impacts of ACB tripping.

-   Facilitate the restoration of customers’ equipment after voltage
    dip.

-   Monitor & facilitate the study of harmonics by non-linear loads and
    provide consultation services to customers.

[]

Diagram 2.1.1 – CPDIS is part of Distribution Network business


current solution and key components

As of Nov 2023, 104 Power Quality (PQ) meters are installed at key
customer’s substations, collecting PQ data and send back to CPDIS
servers located in CDMI zone. PQ Meters are physically connected to a
local 4G Router (with private APN 4G SIM card). The traffic is routed
thru CSL’s 4G-LTE telecommunication network with encrypted connection.

The CPDIS platform consists of servers and applications located inside
CLP’s CMDI3 zone (MS-Azure). It is a landing zone for external
telecommunication network traffic. A barrier to protect the CLP’s
corporate network (CDN). CPDIS application is a head-end system. It is a
proprietary application tied to the CPDIS PQ meters deployed. CPDIS has
no linkage to other corporate systems or other CLP power quality
management system.

Currently, only whitelisted PSBG workstations can assess CPDIS’
webserver (https), therefore, limited which system engineers can assess
the data.

APPLICATION REQUIREMENT


next generation CPDIS applciation servers

The Next Generation CPDIS servers will be established in CDN allowing
wider user access.

The existing servers will remain in CDMI3 but re-purpose as polling
server (store and forward), that will collect the data from meters to
pushed to the new server in CDN through sFTP or EIP.

This requirement is to meet cyber security design requirements.

[]

Diagram 3.1.1 – Conceptual diagram of new CPDIS platform



DATA SOURCE REQUIREMENT


Existing CPDIS in CMDI3

(Phase 1) Voltage dip file (XML file) 

  When a voltage dip occurs, all the meters within the system will send
  a signal to the broker server. This signal triggers the creation of an
  XML file containing relevant information about the voltage dip, such
  as the level of voltage dip for each phase, dip duration, location or
  SCADA data, and other pertinent details. The XML file is then promptly
  transmitted to the CDN servers, ensuring immediate delivery of the
  voltage dip information.

  This process has been in operation since 2023 but is for Power Quality
  Monitoring System (PQMS).

(Phase 1) Power Quality Data Interchange Format (PQDIF)

  It is industrial standard. 10 minutes PQ parameters and waveform would
  be included. The vendor shall capture the parameters and waveform into
  webpage.

  The file has been generated since 2023 to PQMS.

  As per the industrial standard, the system requires the capture and
  storage of 10-minute power quality (PQ) parameters and waveform data
  in compliance with the PQDIF (Power Quality Data Interchange Format)
  specification. The vendor is responsible for capturing these
  parameters and waveform data in accordance with the PQDIF requirements
  and presenting them on a dedicated webpage.

  The PQDIF format ensures standardized data representation, enabling
  compatibility and interoperability between different power quality
  monitoring systems. The captured PQ parameters, such as voltage
  levels, current values, harmonics, and flicker, should be stored in
  the PQDIF format for easy sharing and analysis.

  Furthermore, the waveform data, representing the time-domain
  characteristics of the voltage and current signals during a voltage
  dip event, should also be captured and stored in the PQDIF format.
  This waveform data allows for detailed analysis and visualization of
  the voltage dip waveform, aiding in troubleshooting and identifying
  potential issues.

  This process has been in operation since 2023 but is for Power Quality
  Monitoring System (PQMS).

(Phase 1) Information of meter status

  The system is expected to provide meter status updates (e.g. csv file)
  twice a day. These updates will include essential information such as
  meter name, ID, voltage level, substation, circuit, location, brand,
  model, asset number, serial number, IP address, longitude, and other
  relevant details.

  To meet this new requirement, the system must gather the specified
  meter details twice a day. This information is vital for auto asset
  verification in the future.


Power Quality Monitoring System (PQMS)

(Phase 1) Voltage dip file (XML file)

  The requirement remains the same as stated in session 3.1.1 of the
  specifications. This process has been in operation since 2016 but is
  for Voltage Dip Information System (VDIMS).

(Phase 2) Power Quality Data Interchange Format (PQDIF)

  The requirement remains the same as stated in session 3.1.2 of the
  specifications. This requirement is a new addition for PQMS.

(Phase 2) Information of meter status

  The requirement remains the same as stated in session 3.1.2 of the
  specifications. This requirement is a new addition for PQMS.


Supply Point System (SPS)

(Phase 2) Relationship between customer name (account number), transformer in customer substation and transformer in primary substation

  In order to determine the customers affected by an incident, the
  system needs to establish a linkage between the customers and the
  transformers in the primary substation. This linkage will help
  identify which customers are impacted and enable effective incident
  management.

  Supply Point system (SPS) is scheduled for retirement and will be
  replaced by a new ERP/DNOO system. Further discussions with IT
  colleagues are required to finalize the arrangements for the
  integration of the new system.


EWMS

(Phase 2) IDR information

  The Incident Report (IDR) captures system faults within power system.
  CPDIS is required to establish a mapping between voltage dips and
  system faults in order to associate the two. This mapping will provide
  valuable information such as the type of faulty equipment, the cause
  of the fault, weather conditions, and other relevant details.

  EWMS is scheduled for retirement and will be replaced by a new ERP
  system. Further discussions with IT colleagues are required to
  finalize the arrangements for the integration of the new system.


Other System/customized input

(Phase 2) Relationship between transformer in customer substation and primary substation

  The existing feature provided to VDIMS includes the relationship
  between transformers in customer substations and the primary
  substation as managed by the System Operator (SO). VDIMS is scheduled
  for retirement at end of 2024.

(Phase 2) Weight factor

  The number of customers associated with each transformer in the
  customer substation is recorded and marked.

  This information is available for download from the website of the
  department of System Operation (SO). Currently, users can access the
  SO's website to retrieve the data regarding the number of customers
  assigned to specific transformers in the customer substations.

  The new system is required to automate the mapping process. It should
  conduct the mapping between transformers in the customer substation
  and the primary substation automatically. This automation will
  eliminate the need for manual intervention, ensuring a more efficient
  and accurate mapping between the two substations in the system.

 (Phase 2) Sensitive customer list

  Currently, the list is updated annually by the account manager.
  However, with the launch of DNOO/ADMS, the account manager will have
  the capability to directly update the list within the system. This
  transition allows for more streamlined and immediate updates to the
  list. Further discussions will be held to finalize the arrangements
  for this new update process. (new customer list is difference from the
  list in DNOO/ADMS).



FEATURE OF SYSTEM


Individual meter view 

(Phase 1) Voltage sag/swell: The system should support real-time event notification (notification requirement will show in later part of this document) from each individual meter to the central system whenever a voltage dip occurs. Upon receiving the notification from a specific meter, the system should promptly log and display the voltage sag events associated with that meter in a list format on a dedicated webpage.

(Phase 1) Waveform: For each event, the system generates a waveform accompanied by advanced analysis features. These tools may include features such as zooming, scaling, filtering, harmonic analysis, and time-domain analysis.

  [A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated]

(Phase 1) Meter event log: The meter is equipped with event logging capabilities, enabling it to record any events or incidents that occur within the meter itself. These events may include various types of issues, such as power quality disturbances, communication errors, or other meter-specific events.

  Once an event is logged, the meter sends the event log to both the
  broker server and the central server. The purpose of this data
  transmission is to facilitate debugging and problem fixing processes.

[A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated]

(Phase 1) 10 minutes log: The system or solution shall have the capability to log and record different parameter (as captured below) profiles at 10-minute intervals. This includes capturing and storing relevant parameters such as voltage levels, harmonics, flicker, and other characteristics specified in the EN50160 standard.

(Phase 1) Voltage: voltage characteristics of electricity supplied by public distribution systems.

(Phase 1) Current: no current transformer is fully deployed; the system will provide existing status according to site conditions

(Phase 1) Power Factor: a measure of the efficiency of electrical power utilization. It indicates the ratio of real power (kW) to apparent power (kVA) in an electrical system.

(Phase 1) Individual harmonic (i.e. up to 24^(th) order): additional frequency components present in an electrical system that are multiples of the fundamental frequency

(Phase 1) TDD (Total Demand Distortion): TDD refers to the total harmonic distortion of the demand current or load current in an electrical system. It measures the distortion caused by harmonics in relation to the fundamental current. 

(Phase 1) THDI (Total Harmonic Distortion of Current): THDI measures the distortion caused by harmonics in the current waveform of an electrical system. 

(Phase 1) THDV (Total Harmonic Distortion of Voltage): THDV measures the distortion caused by harmonics in the voltage waveform of an electrical system. 

  (Log profile included but not limited as mentioned)

[A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated]

[A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated]


Event view

(Phase 1) Sag/Swell (including affected customer, IDR and SARFI) with false event setting and filtering feature: The system provides a table where all voltage dip events can be listed. It includes features such as exporting the data in CSV/Excel format, false event settings, and filtering options. The affected customers are mapped to each event, allowing for the evaluation of societal impact.

  In the previous VDIMS system, once a voltage dip occurred, the
  affected customers were immediately mapped to the corresponding event.
  It was not possible to add the affected customers back. To address
  this challenge, discussions should be held to determine the best
  approach, as management may express interest in specific customers
  that were not initially mentioned. To tackle the concern, the past SPS
  record, transformer mapping files, and other related data cannot be
  removed from the system on a daily basis and should be retained for a
  specified period of time.

  The system also allows access to the waveform associated with each
  event. Information included in the event list comprises the incident
  time, voltage level, location, meter name, duration of the dip, dip
  level of the three-phase voltage, IDR, and other relevant details.

(Phase 1) Mother event list: refers to the primary event that serves as the source of a system fault, which subsequently triggers a voltage dip. In the case of a transmission fault, a group of events is triggered as a result of the voltage dip.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| (reference to existing mechanism)                                     |
|                                                                       |
| In the event of a voltage dip, the system will enter a pending state  |
| for a few minutes to collect all triggered XML files from different   |
| meters.                                                               |
|                                                                       |
| After a few minutes, the system will examine the triggered files to   |
| determine if they include data from 132kV and 400kV meters. If both   |
| 132kV/400kV and 11kV meters are triggered simultaneously, the voltage |
| dip event will be identified, recorded in the system, and a           |
| notification will be generated. The number of meters that can trigger |
| the event is configurable, with a current minimum requirement of at   |
| least three meters at the 132kV/400kV and 11kV levels.                |
|                                                                       |
| If no transmission level meters are triggered, the system will check  |
| for an 11kV voltage dip. If two meters with the same SCADA name but   |
| connected to different transformers are triggered simultaneously,     |
| indicating that the transformers are in parallel, the event will be   |
| identified.                                                           |
|                                                                       |
| If only one meter is triggered, the system will check for overcurrent |
| triggers or fault recorder triggers. If both occur simultaneously,    |
| the event can be identified.                                          |
|                                                                       |
| In cases where overcurrent or fault recorder alarms are not           |
| available, the system will mark it down in a list labelled "11kV      |
| Overcurrent Filtering." If a meter is triggered without an            |
| overcurrent or fault recorder trigger but is present in the list, the |
| event will be identified.                                             |
|                                                                       |
| If an event does not meet the requirements as mentioned, it will be   |
| considered a "false alarm" and ignored by the system.                 |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

(Phase 1) All event list: include detailed information about each event, such as timestamp, duration, location, and any associated data or parameters. 

(Phase 1) Search incident (with different search criteria): allows users to search for specific incidents based on different criteria; may include incident timestamp, location, voltage level, duration, affected customers, or any other relevant parameters available in the system.

  [A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated]

(Phase 2) Reporting for supply reliability: includes a reporting feature specifically designed to generate supply reliability reports. These reports provide the more detailed information of the system fault that updated in IDR and EWMS. (note that EWMS is scheduled to retirement in 2025 or 2026; further arrangement will be discussed)

[A screenshot of a calendar Description automatically generated]

(Phase 1) Harmonic events: EN50160 addresses harmonics and specifies limits for harmonic distortion in voltage and current waveforms. These limits aim to ensure the quality of the electricity supply and protect electrical equipment from the adverse effects of excessive harmonics.

(Phase 1) Voltage deviation events: According to EN50160, a voltage deviation event refers to a departure from the specified voltage levels in an electrical system. EN50160 defines limits for voltage deviations to ensure the quality and stability of the electricity supply.

(Phase 1) Flickering Events: Flickering is typically caused by rapid voltage fluctuations. EN50160 addresses flickering and provides guidelines to ensure acceptable levels of flicker in electrical systems. The standard defines limits for flicker severity and flicker perception to maintain the quality of the electricity supply.

(Phase 1) Transient Events: Transient events refer to short-duration disturbances in the electrical system characterized by sudden changes in voltage or current. EN50160 specifies limits for transient disturbances, such as voltage dips and voltage surges, to ensure that they remain within acceptable levels. These limits define parameters related to the magnitude, duration, and frequency of transients.

(Phase 1) Power Factor list: It represents the ratio of real power to apparent power. EN50160 defines limits for power factor to ensure that it remains within acceptable levels. These limits specify the minimum required power factor for different types of electrical installations or consumer categories.

(Phase 1) Voltage dip benchmarking (ITIC, SEMI F47, IEC61000-11/34): Voltage dip benchmarking is a process that involves comparing voltage dip events in an electrical system against established standards or guidelines to determine compliance and performance. The three commonly referenced standards for voltage dip benchmarking are ITIC (Information Technology Industry Council), SEMI F47, and IEC61000-11/34.

  ITIC provides guidelines for voltage dip immunity levels for
  information technology equipment. SEMI is an international industry
  association focusing on semiconductor manufacturing and related
  industries. This standard, published by the International
  Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), provides guidelines for voltage dip
  immunity levels for electrical equipment connected to low-voltage
  power supply networks.

|   With the default setting, the pre-fault (Irms) is the average of    |
|   the 10 RMS pre-fault samples on 3 phases. When the load current     |
|   cannot get back to 50% or more of the pre-fault loading (Irms)      |
|   within 10s, it will be treated as an ACB tripping case, i.e. the    |
|   “ACB tripping” field is “Y”.                                        |

Asset management

(Phase 1) Meter Status (Active, Abnormal, Inactive): The system shall provide updated information for each meter, categorizing them as active, abnormal, or inactive. This allows for quick identification and monitoring of meter functionality. Active meters are those currently operational and functioning normally. Abnormal status indicates meters with detected anomalies or issues that require attention. Inactive meters are those temporarily out of service or not currently operational.

(Phase 1) Map View: The system shall include a map view feature that displays the geographical locations of meters. Each meter's location will be marked on the map along with additional information such as building type and connection status. The map view will provide a visual representation of the meter distribution across various locations. Filter options will be available, enabling users to sort and view meters based on different criteria, such as building type, meter status, voltage level, and more.

(Phase 1) Meter Inventory (Combined with Meter Hierarchy): The system shall maintain a comprehensive meter inventory, which includes a list of all meters within the system. Each meter will be identified with an asset number and will be associated with specific details such as location, serial number, IP address, and other relevant information. The meter inventory will be synchronized with the SAP/ERP system to ensure accurate and up-to-date asset information. The data in the meter inventory will be updated twice a day to reflect any changes or additions to the metering infrastructure. The features will fulfil the requirements of automate asset verification process.


System maintenance

(Phase 1) Meter Enabling:

  The system shall provide a functionality to enable/disable
  notifications during maintenance or unexpected incidents. This feature
  allows users to temporarily suspend notifications to avoid unnecessary
  alerts during maintenance activities or when dealing with unforeseen
  incidents.

  The system shall allow for easy configuration of system parameters.
  Users will have the ability to adjust and customize various settings
  such as measurement intervals, data collection parameters, and other
  relevant parameters to meet specific requirements.

(Phase 1) Meter Log:

  The system shall maintain a log of meter activities and events. This
  log will provide a historical record of meter operations, including
  data related to measurements, communication events, alarms, and other
  significant events. The meter log will serve as a valuable resource
  for troubleshooting, analysis, and auditing purposes.

(Phase 1) User Profile Management:

  The system shall support user profile management, allowing
  administrators to create, modify, and control user access levels and
  privileges. User profiles will be associated with specific roles,
  ensuring secure and controlled access to system functionalities based
  on individual user responsibilities.

(Phase 1) Report of Meter Data and Communication Availability:

  The system shall generate reports consolidating meter data and
  communication availability. These reports will provide insights into
  the performance of the metering infrastructure, data availability,
  communication status, and other relevant metrics. The reports will aid
  in system monitoring, analysis, and decision-making processes.

(Phase 2) Customer Information and Transformer Mapping:

  The system shall include a module to linkage between customer and
  supply transformer. This functionality will enable the association of
  meters with their respective customers and facilitate impact of each
  voltage dip event.

(Phase 1) Notification Template:

  The system shall provide customizable notification templates for
  various events and conditions. Users will be able to configure
  notifications based on specific thresholds, alarms, or events,
  ensuring timely and accurate communication of critical information to

  The system includes SCADA codes in the meter names, which serves as a
  unique identifier for each meter. The system shall provide full name
  of the SCADA code, which corresponds to the location name. By
  providing the location name associated with each meter,
  non-engineering staff members can easily track issues and provide
  support to customers using familiar location references.

(Phase 1) 11kV Overcurrent Filtering:

  Typically, overcurrent signals are checked when a voltage dip event is
  triggered. However, there may be situations where the current
  transformer or other current detection devices are unavailable or
  malfunctioning. To address this, the system includes a feature that
  allows the user to disable the counter check of each meter. Disabling
  the counter check prevents the system from overlooking voltage dip
  events due to missing or faulty current detection devices.

(Phase 2) Weight Factor for SARFI Calculation:

  The system shall support the input and management of weight factors
  required for SARFI (System Average RMS Flicker Index) calculation.
  Weight factors can be directly inputted from the System Operator (SO)
  and updated on a daily and yearly basis. The ability to configure the
  frequency of weight factor updates will be a configurable option
  within the system.


Notification

(Phase 1) Event notification (i.e. voltage dip)

(Phase 1)The system shall provide event notifications through SMS and email to the system administrator and users, if necessary. This ensures that relevant stakeholders receive timely voltage dip notifications.

 (Phase 1)Additionally, the system will generate XML/API files that can be transmitted to the DNOO, PIOCO, or other CLP systems. These files will contain relevant event information, facilitating seamless integration and information exchange between different systems.

(Phase 1) System alert 

(Phase 1) Disconnected from on-premises servers and systems

  The system will monitor the connection status to on-premises servers
  and systems, including existing PQMS (Power Quality Monitoring System)
  and existing CPDIS (Centralized Power Distribution Information
  System). Regular health check files and event files will be sent from
  these on-premises systems. In the event that no file is received
  within a defined timeframe, an alert will be generated and sent to
  system administrators. This alert will serve as a notification of the
  disconnection, enabling prompt investigation and resolution of any
  connectivity issues.
